Want a softcopy of a paper document? With a scan of your 
document, our Optical Character Recognition (OCR) will turn 
an image into text! Spilled coffee on the paper? No problem!
Our OCR will look past the stained image to produce a text file.

Given the scan, font information, and image resolution, our
software will filter your image down to the characters that
comprise it, produce the best match for each character, and
return a text file.

May you enjoy the convenience our product provides!
