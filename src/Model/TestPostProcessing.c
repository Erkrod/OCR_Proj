/*this file will be used to test post processing

Input will be hard coded in the program: An array of CharProfile, each CharProfile contains an array of CharProbability

Output will be ut_string type, character after character includes newline character too

Phase 1: take only the character with the highest probability at one spot

Phase 2: The algorithm should be able to match C syntax as much as possible
